There is an inconsistency in behavior of current QuerySet.get_or_create():
It avoids unnecessary DB query for related object given as argument
only if created is True.
I gave a script demonstrating this here:
https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/34884
The patch of get_or_create() can be replaced by
a more general patch on QuerySet.get().
