-------------------------------------------------------------------------
In current versions of Django, a prefetch use the ordering defined
on the class prefetched.
class Meta:
    ordering = ...
But when you prefetch and there is a single value per current object
that will recieve the prefetch in its cache,
then the ordering is totally useless.
It adds useless load on the DB server.
The goal of these patches is to remove this order by
for many versions of Django.
On very big prefetches I noticed a gain of 10 - 15 %,
since the rest of the DB query is mainly an index scan.
#ClimateChangeBrake
Note that I also submitted a ticket and a PR:
https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/35309
https://github.com/django/django/pull/17984
So, we can hope for the better that future releases of Django
will not have this problem,
and maybe older versions if it is backported to some.
