Django Rest Framework is considered "feature-complete".
But if you had the chance to work with an in-house framework
like I did in PHP for 8,5 years,
you know that there is no such thing as a "feature-complete" framework ;).
The goal of this patch is to have a sensible place to add unconventional prefetches.
You may apply the patch,
or use patched_to_representation_v1 in a class inheriting from ListSerializer.
