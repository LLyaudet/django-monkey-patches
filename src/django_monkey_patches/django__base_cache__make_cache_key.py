    Add a simple "test_cache" prefix plus the current pid.
    The local memory cache is isolated between processes.
    But it may not be the case of a Redis backend cache, for example.

    It may seem inefficient to call os.getpid() here,
    but Django loads settings only once even when multiple processes
    are used for parallel tests.
    And the BaseCache related objects are common.
    So setting KEY_PREFIX is not enough.

    For example, apply it in your settings file with:
    # if len(sys.argv) > 1 and sys.argv[1] == "test":
    if TESTING:
        for cache in CACHES.values():
