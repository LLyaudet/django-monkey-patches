To optimize some queries, you may need to add prefetches
that apply only to some of the instances.
It is very convenient when you have some expensive prefetches
that concerns only a few instances.
Hence, I added a filter_callback argument to Prefetch.
#ClimateChangeBrake
Note that I also submitted a ticket and a PR:
https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/35317
https://github.com/django/django/pull/17994
So, we can hope for the better that future releases of Django
will have this feature,
and maybe older versions if it is backported to some.
