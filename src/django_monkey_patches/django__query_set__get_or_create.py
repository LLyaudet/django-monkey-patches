There is an inconsistency in behavior of current QuerySet.get_or_create():
It avoids unnecessary DB query for related object given as argument
only if created is True.
I gave a script demonstrating this here:
https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/34884
In my tests, this patch yields a speed up of almost 10 %,
since it avoids many unnecessary queries.
